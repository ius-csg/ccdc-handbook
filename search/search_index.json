To use, download from GitHub and run ./lynis audit system . A long list of suggestions and warnings will be output. A custom auditing profile can be found in the scripts repo, but is not required. RKhunter RKhunter is a Linux rootkit and backdoor scanner avalible in most repos. It checks for known backdoors, wrong file permissions, and checksums some binaries. To run all checks (requires root): rkhunter --check By default, the output is logged at /var/log/rkhunter.log See also: Techmint SUSE Wiki User Whowatch Whowatch is a realtime user and process monitor. It interactivly shows the output of the w command, and allows you to kill the users login and processes from the TUI. To launch, use the command whowatch . While in the TUI, press s to view system info, or t to view the process tree. See also: TechMint User information To see all logged in users, from where, and what they are doing, use the w command. To list all user accounts on the system, see the /etc/passwd file. All users in the 'root' group or with UID 0, or named 'root' have superuser access. Example: root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash Is a superuser because the account is named root. It is also the superuser because it has user ID 0, and has group root.

For example, when the string \"Service\" is used powershell will show all commands that involve Services. Often a command will give much more output than is desired. If searching for a specific property, such as name, the select command can be used to filter out all the unnecessary information Get-Service | select Name The above command will first retrieve the information about the services, but then will only display the selected attribute, the names. Discovering the System Environment Variables Environment variables can be used to discover many system properties. All environment variables are in the form \"$env: \" where is the name of the specific variable. A couple of useful environment variables are listed below. $env:OS $env:ComputerName $env:Username There are many other environment variables. Processes & Services Another point of interest on the system is discovering process and services.This is simple to do in powershell. Get-EventLog requires the name of the log that is to be retrieved (Ex/ Application) Get-Process Get-Service Get-Eventlog Remember the use of \"Get-Command -Noun \" can be used to discover other commands that could interact with the Process or Service is those keywords are passed to the -Noun Option Users Discovering the users is an important step in the administrative process. This includes both the names of users and, more importantly, the groups that those users are a part of. Get-WmiObject Win32_useraccount Get-WmiObject Win32_group Get-WmiObject Win32_groupuser These commands will display the user accounts, groups, and users contained in a specific group respectively. Administrative users are very important to keep track of so this script displays some account information of every administer on the local computer. Get-WmiObject win32_groupuser | Where-Object { $_.groupcomponent -match 'administrators' } | ForEach-Object {[wmi]$_.partcomponent} Once this information is discovered it may be desirable to discover more about the user accounts or change some attributes of the account. In order to do this a varible containing an User object can be created. [adsi]$userVar = \"winNT://<ComputerName>/<username>\" Where is the name of the computer the account is on is the name of the account After creation the User Variable's properties can be examined or changed. $userVar.lastlogin $userVar.badpasswordattempts $userVar.setpassword(\"CantPwnMe\") Invoking these commands will display the property or change it as appropriate. There are many other properties, these are but a few interesting examples.","title":"Powershell Basics"},{"location":"Windows/Powershell/#powershell-basics","text":"Finding out more about any given command Get-help [Command] Great way to discover new commands Get-Command Get-Command -Noun Get-Command by itself will simply spew out all commands currently installed.The noun option allows you to look for commands that affect any given noun. For example, when the string \"Service\" is used powershell will show all commands that involve Services. Often a command will give much more output than is desired. If searching for a specific property, such as name, the select command can be used to filter out all the unnecessary information Get-Service | select Name The above command will first retrieve the information about the services, but then will only display the selected attribute, the names.","title":"Powershell Basics"},{"location":"Windows/Powershell/#discovering-the-system","text":"","title":"Discovering the System"},{"location":"Windows/Powershell/#environment-variables","text":"Environment variables can be used to discover many system properties.
